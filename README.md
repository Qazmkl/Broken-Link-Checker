# Broken-Link-Checker
A Java program made as a side-project in my co-op that crawls through a given URL and scans their response codes and take screenshots (if enabled), then outputs its results into an Excel file. Developed using standard Java API, threads, JSwing, JSoup, Selenium, and Apache POI.

# Purpose & Value
The purpose of this program is to quickly detect all broken/invalid links and their sources in a given site as well as any appearance or browser related defects (through screenshots) for later fixing.
The value of this program is that it greatly speeds up the QA process to find any defects related to links or appearance in a website. (This is especially useful when creating a new web environment.)

# How to Install
The installation process for this program is simply getting the project files and unzipping them on to your computer.
If you want to be able to use this on the Eclipse IDE there are several more steps to take:
-	Run Eclipse
-	Go to File->Import
-	Click on Maven->Existing Maven Projects->Next
-	Browse and select the unzipped project folder, then finish

# How to Run
To start the program, you can either:
-	Run the JAR file inside the project folder
-	Run the project through Eclipse (F11)

# Program Capabilities
-	Runs on JRE version 1.8+ (IMPORTANT)
-	Maven project made in Eclipse
-	Operates using an internet connection
-	Uses JSoup to parse document
-	Uses threads (runnable)
-	Creates new folders and lets user choose where to save results
-	Outputs to an Excel file
-	Uses a JSwing UI
-	Can stop mid-scan
-	Takes screenshots using Selenium

# General Program Flow
1.	Program starts
2.	GUI opens
3.	User fills in details
4.	User starts scan (scan button disabled and stop button enabled)
5.	Main thread (runnable) starts
6.	Link scraping threads are created (threads to find links) by main thread
7.	Link scraping threads start scanning webpages
8.	Link scraping threads save results to temp file (URL, Origin URL, Link Text)
9.	Main thread reads temp file
10.	Main thread splits results into multiple smaller lists
11.	Response code threads are created by main thread with the lists
12.	Response code threads start scanning given list
13.	Response code threads save results into second temp file (Title, Response Code)
14.	Main Thread reads second temp file
15.	Main Thread combines results from both temp files
16.	Main Thread creates an Excel document using the results
17.	Main Thread deletes temp files
18.	Current scan is completed (scan button enabled and stop button disabled)
